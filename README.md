# Human Activity Recognition with Random Forest in R

This is the assignment about predicting human activity classe with five levels (A, B, C, D, E) in R. In this project, we build a machine learning model to classify exercising activities based on sensor data collected from the belt, arm, forearm, and dumbbell. Under the caret package, we train the model using the random forest method. 

Next, we use this trained model to predict activity classes (A, B, C, D, E) on 20 new test cases, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize new results.
